Fewbytes omnibus software

Fewbytes omnibus software configurations

Using

Currently, omnibus specifically looks for the omnibus-software gem. So one would have to extract the software files
included in this repostiroy to actually use them. I'm hoping to find a time to patch original omnibus-ruby package and
add support for 3rd party Gems with software configurations.
